======================================================================

`dockly` is a gem made to ease the pain of packaging an application. For this gem to be useful, you will want to use [Docker](http://docker.io) for process isolation.

Although only a specific type of repository may be used, these assumptions allow us to define a simple DSL to describe your repository.

Tool Requirements
-----------------

To use the generated startup scripts, you'll need to use AWS CLI v1.5.0+

Usage
-----

Once a package block has been defined by the DSL below, dockly is invoked by either (for a deb) `bundle exec dockly build #{deb block name}` or `bundle exec rake dockly:deb:#{deb block name}`.
If looking to just build a `docker` block, run either `bundle exec dockly docker #{docker block name}` or `bundle exec rake dockly:docker:#{docker block name}`.
To build without exporting, run add either `--no-export` or `:noexport` to the CLI program or Rake task

The DSL
-------

The DSL is broken down into multiple objects, all of which conform to a specific format. Each object starts with the name of the section,
followed by a name for the object you're creating, and a block for configuration.

```ruby
docker :test_docker do
  # code here
end
```

Each object has an enumeration of valid attributes. The following code sets the `repository` attribute in a `docker` called `test_docker`:

```ruby
docker :test_docker do
  repository 'an-awesome-name'
end
```

Finally, each object has zero or more valid references to other DSL objects. The following code sets `deb` that references a `docker`:

```ruby
docker :my_docker do
  repository 'my-name'
end

deb :my_deb do
  docker :my_docker
end
```

Below is an alternative syntax that accomplishes the same thing:

```ruby
deb :my_deb do
  docker do
    repository 'my-name'
  end
end
```
